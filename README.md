# Video-Downloader

A simple script to help you download videos from internet(youtube or any other media site).
This basically requires 2 modules : requests and pytube <br/> 
Just do "**pip install pytube**" and "**pip install requests**" in your command prompt.<br/>

Many times the code shows an error about connection problem but the code is working and is tested.<br/>
sometimes its just the internet problem. Make sure to check that you have a good internet connection.<br/>
